# Tictactoe
Just a simple tictactoe game with Socket programming and multi threading. I works Completly fine. might need to change port.

I made a simple game with a server side handling the clients hosting games between them and the client just comming and playing
the games. each client is treated as a thread. I have done Implicit Synchronization via Shared Memory and Turn-Based Logic
Prevents Race Conditions.
